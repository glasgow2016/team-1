  "Ninety-two per cent of cats are \"Moggies\", or, non-pedigrees. How did the name \"Moggie\" come about? One theory holds that it comes from old English dialect, where \"Moggie\" was used to designate a loose woman or prostitute. It is thought that this name was given to cats because they mate repeatedly with different males when they are in season."
